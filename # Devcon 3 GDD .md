# Devcon 3 GDD | "Chestnut Chase" 

Made by: **Parker Hamilton, Aiden Gibson, Aiden Boyd**

# Overview  

We developed a physics-based 3D platformer where the protagonist is a squirrel. As the squirrel eats acorns, it grows in size and mass, which allows it to manipulate increasingly heavier objects and overcome environmental obstacles. The game combines platforming with physics puzzles, where the player must use the squirrel's increasing size and strength to progress through different levels. The squirrel's ability to move, push, and lift objects is crucial for solving puzzles and navigating through the world.

# Objective Statement

“How does the physical growth of the squirrel, in terms of size and mass, influence gameplay mechanics like object interaction, movement, and puzzle-solving?” 

We want to explore how the increasing mass and size of the squirrel can provide dynamic challenge and satisfaction, while ensuring that the gameplay experience remains balanced and fun. The prototype will allow us to test and iterate on how the squirrel’s growth impacts physics interactions, such as how much weight it can push or how fast it moves.

# Design Rationale


### What do you envision?

We envision a game where players feel a sense of progression through the squirrel's growth and increasing abilities. The design is centered around physics-based interaction, where the player’s actions have clear consequences. As the squirrel eats acorns, it gradually grows, which unlocks the ability to manipulate larger and heavier objects, such as rocks or doors, and opens up new areas for exploration.

### Informed by metrics:

As the squirrel grows, its mass increases according to a power-scale model. This makes the squirrel increasingly effective at moving objects that are heavier than itself, but it also impacts its mobility.

### Engagement Beyond Simulation

The player must decide when to eat acorns and how to use their increased mass to solve puzzles. This provides a strategic element where players balance power with mobility, creating a dynamic experience that requires both problem-solving and reflex-based platforming.

# Metric Research

The game’s physics mechanics are inspired by real-world scaling laws. For example, when an object’s size increases, its volume and mass grows by the scaling factor. In real-world biology, as creatures grow larger, their muscle mass increases at a slower rate than their body mass, which leads to diminished mobility. The same concept is applied to the squirrel, while it can push heavier objects, it will also experience slower movement and more difficulty jumping as it grows larger.
